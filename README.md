# barbell-activity-recognition
This project is an implementation of the HAR pipeline suggested in "Exploring the Possibilities of Context-Aware Applications for Strength Training - Dave Ebbelaar." It uses wristband accelerometer and gyroscope data to track strength training exercises and count repetitions with the help of machine learning algorithms trained on barbell exercise datasets.
